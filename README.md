# Laboratory work 2 (data structures)

## Task: 

Implement data structure - **Deque**.

Requirements: perform the operations of inserting, returning an element without deleting, 
deleting (for example - return and delete the first element from the stack),
and search for a specific element (if such an operation is supported by the data structure)
